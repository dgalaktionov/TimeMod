# TimeMod
A mod for Game Dev Tycoon to enable SimCity-like time controls

## Features
The mod adds four buttons to the game: pause, slow motion, play and fast, respectively. The pause overrides any other pause in the game, meaning that the game will stay paused until any other speed is selected, no matter what dialogs are opened or closed. It also mantains the state in saved games.
